# MileEnd_Audio_Classification
## MileEnd Spoken Numerals classification using Macine Learning

The major parts of the projects are,
  1. Data Creation
  2. Building the Classifier model that classifies the intonation of short audio clips using the Mile End Spoken Numerals.

## Data Creation

Dataset was developed by the School of Electonics Engineering & Computer Science of the Queen Mary University of London. Roughly 185 postgraduate students contributed wth audio clips. Audio clips were further separated, cleaned and published by the team led by Dr. Jesus Requena-Carrion. Audio clips contain different numbers spoken by students in different intonations viz. Excited, Bored, Question and Neutral.
